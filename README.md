RF Step Attenuator: Adjustable Attenuation Gives Precise Signal Levels.

Switch Attenuator, 
When dealing with radio-frequency signals, it often comes in handy to have an easy way to attenuate a signal level in discrete steps. For example, you might want to reduce the output of an RF generator to a lower level than the output control on the generator allows, and there are many other applications of attenuators in the adjustment and repair of receivers and other radio equipment.
